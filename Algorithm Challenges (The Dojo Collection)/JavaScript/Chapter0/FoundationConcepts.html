How many values are accepted by the == and === operators?
2

Do inputs to the == and === operators need to be of the same data type?
No for ==
Yes for === <- incorrect

Answer: They do not need to be of the same type for either operator.
However, if not the same type, === returns false.
The == operator insternally converts values to the same type before comparing.


What is the data type returned by the == and === operators?
Boolean

RECURSION:
1 (Base Case): How you stop your recursion aka the simplest input. (The input for which you receive an output without a recursive call)
2 (Next Simplest Input): Optionally write another next simplest input
3 (Look for a Pattern): Look for a way to build your output by using the base case.
    return (build 2nd simplest from simplest)
